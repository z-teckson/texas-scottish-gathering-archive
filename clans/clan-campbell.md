# Clan Campbell

## Origins and History

Clan Campbell (Scottish Gaelic: *Na Caimbeulaich*) is one of the largest and most powerful Highland clans, with historical origins in Argyll on the west coast of Scotland. The clan’s chief is the **Duke of Argyll**, and the clan motto is *“Ne obliviscaris”* (Forget Not).

The Campbells rose to prominence in the medieval period, often acting as agents of the Scottish crown in the Highlands. They played a major role in the politics of Scotland, especially during the Wars of Scottish Independence and the Jacobite uprisings.

## Campbell Tartans

- **Campbell of Argyll** – The main tartan, a green‑based sett with navy and black lines.
- **Campbell of Breadalbane** – A lighter, more yellow‑dominated variant.
- **Campbell of Cawdor** – A red‑based tartan with green and navy.

## Campbells in Texas

Scottish immigrants bearing the Campbell name began arriving in Texas in the early 19th century, many settling in the Hill Country and East Texas. Campbells were among the signers of the Texas Declaration of Independence and fought in the Texas Revolution.
