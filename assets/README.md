# Assets Directory

This folder stores images, logos, documents, and other media related to the Scottish Gathering of the Clans in Texas.

## Guidelines for Adding Assets

1. **File Naming**
   - Use descriptive, lowercase names with hyphens (e.g., `2023-opening-ceremony.jpg`).
   - Include the year and subject when possible.

2. **Allowed File Types**
   - Images: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.svg`
   - Documents: `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.md`
   - Archives: `.zip` (only if necessary)
   - Audio/Video: `.mp3`, `.mp4`, `.mov` (please keep files reasonably sized)

3. **Organization**
   - Create sub‑folders by year (e.g., `2023/`, `2022/`) for event‑specific media.
   - Use sub‑folders by clan name (e.g., `campbell/`, `macdonald/`) for clan‑related images.
   - For general logos or branding, place files directly in `assets/`.

4. **Licensing**
   - Only upload media that you have permission to share.
   - Prefer public‑domain, Creative Commons, or original work.
   - If an asset is not your own, include a `LICENSE.txt` file in the same folder describing its origin and terms of use.
