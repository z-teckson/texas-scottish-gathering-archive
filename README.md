# Texas Scottish Gathering of the Clans Archive

A collaborative digital archive for the annual Scottish Gathering of the Clans in Texas. This repository serves as a lasting, collaborative, and easily updatable digital archive documenting the history of the event, participating clans, and key activities for historical preservation and public education.

## Purpose

As a dedicated historian and advocate of Scottish history and culture in Texas, I aim to preserve the event's history beyond fleeting social media posts or printed programs. This GitHub repository allows for version control, community contribution, and a structured way to manage historical information—a modern tool for traditional purposes.

## Repository Structure

- **`gatherings/`** – Markdown files for each year's event (e.g., `2023.md`, `2022.md`).
- **`clans/`** – Markdown files for each Scottish clan that has participated (e.g., `clan-campbell.md`, `clan-macgregor.md`).
- **`assets/`** – Images, logos, documents, and other media related to the gatherings and clans.
- **`README.md`** – This file, providing an overview and contribution guidelines.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** – Detailed instructions for contributing to the archive (forthcoming).
